# Measuring Web Vitals

**Abstract**: Without data, there's no way to know if we're delivering great experiences to our users. In this talk we'll look at tools for measuring and monitoring how real users experience Core Web Vitals, which are the loading, interactivity, and layout stability metrics that affect a site's performance.
